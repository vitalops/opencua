# Scheduler

## Start the background runner

Schedules are saved to disk but only execute when the daemon is running:

```bash
opendesk scheduler start
```

To list schedules without starting the daemon:

```bash
opendesk scheduler list
```

Natural language tasks (non-replay) require Claude API access:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENDESK_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6  # optional, this is the default
opendesk scheduler start
```
